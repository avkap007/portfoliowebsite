## Requirements

Although this assignment is open-ended, I highly recommend developing a personal website to add more projects to your portfolio which will be helpful for your future job applications!

Note: personal websites are _meant_ to be **personal**. Try to make it unique to you and only share information you're comfortable with. Due to privacy reasons, you can choose to develop another website that still meets the requirements of this assignment.

### Personal Website

Your website could include some of the following elements (these are just suggestions)

- Short bio about who you are + picture
- List of your previous/current projects + links to github repo
- Programming Skills ad related projects (could be combined with the item above)
- Link to professional social media i.e. LinkedIn, Github etc.
- Work experience
- Volunteer experience
- Education
- What youâ€™re passionate about
- Link to resume
